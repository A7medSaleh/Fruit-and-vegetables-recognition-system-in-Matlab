In this code I build a fruits and vegetables recognition system by extracting both primitive features and semantic features of dataset images and use those to train machine learning model (you can know which model is used in comments inside code)which is saved to a file then this model is used to classify any new input image and recognize the fruit or vegetable type in this input image.

The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program and it runs on MATLAB platform.

This software can be used in various fields like research in field of image retrieval and image processing also in field of machine learning and it can be used in supermarkets.
